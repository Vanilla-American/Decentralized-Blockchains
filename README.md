### Abstract
The current format for how crypto-currencies are exchanged is not just flawed, but a hindrance to furthering interoperability between the current blockchains. The use and promotion of decentralized exchanges would give more power to users to not only protect their personal data but also offer another route for users to connect with and trade with other blockchains. The solution to making decentralized exchanges more prominent varies, but various methods such as providing more incentive to users through better personal security, reasonable or low transaction fees, and complete automation are som,e options, to name a few.

## The Problem

The concept and implementation of a crypto-currency exchange is crucial to ensure the crypto-currencies and the blockchains they were built on not only succeed but thrive as well. Without exchanges, crypto-currencies would not be where they are today. The monetary presence and backing gave blockchain technologies and their associated currencies the support and boost that made blockchain a true financial system. 
However, the current implementations of the biggest exchanges around the world have some very crucial and detrimental flaws for users that go against the very foundations of what blockchains want to achieve. The cause of these flaws? **Centralization.**
Centralization simply means that all of the information, data, and more importantly crypto-currencies, are handled by central figures that control everything happening within the determined space, or exchange in this instance. For comparison, all banks around the world are centralized, and they were the very things blockchain technologies were trying to avoid.
For all enthusiasts, it is obvious why they choose crypto-currencies over the standard banking system. Having complete control of your funds and not having to entrust those funds, or personal information, to a single entity makes clear sense, and is where **decentralized exchanges** come in.

## DEXs: A Stepping Stone to Interoperability

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide the same functionality as typically centralized exchanges but have the exact opposite foundations. DEXs are built with the intention of keeping the values of all blockchains, entailing protected user information, and no central entity controlling transactions. Along with these premises, there are other features that are direct outcomes from them. Features such as almost complete anonymity, from lack of regulations and KYC processes, direct peer-to-peer transactions with very small transaction fees, and financial security due to having your funds in your possession and not on a centralized exchange to name the more prominent ones.
These base premises and additional features of DEXs are enough for most enthusiasts to agree that they are the better way of trading, but then why are less than **one percent** of transactions handled on DEXs?
Simple. There is not enough volume of trade occurring in the DEXs, which is caused by a lack of users using other exchanges to trade and vice versa. These two factors alone are enough to account for why DEXs are rare in use, but it is further hindered by how entrenched the current centralized exchanges are in the world of blockchain.
With all of this said, why are DEXs important to interoperability? 
They are important because they offer a different avenue for the user to connect and trade with other blockchains, creating more interoperability on its own, and aids in showing that centralized exchanges do not want more interoperability, they want money which is achieved by controlling where the transactions are being handled, not by allowing users to directly access other blockchains without a man in the middle.

## The Solution(s)

It is not a coincidence that this issue and all other issues related to interoperability have not been solved earlier, they are not easy issues to fix and it is safe to assume that if there were a simple and known way to fix them, it would have been implemented by now. 
At this point, the situation and issue presented is well known and contemplated by many people smarter than myself and my team. So what solutions do we bring to the table? 
We believe that by creating a DEX with a vast library of nearly all crypto-currencies and all the benefits of having a DEX should be enough for any crypto trader, but in reality, this is nowhere near enough to cause a shift in DEX exchange use. The DEX would need to provide enough incentive to switch from the corporate giant they trust, or simply use because they have nowhere else to quickly and easily trade crypto, to the relatively infant in size cousin DEX. 
However, I am only one man with some friends just giving my take on the situation and what I think would best solve the problem, so having expectations to see huge groundbreaking results overnight is unreasonable. This is why starting with small solutions and or big improvements over time could have drastic effects later that we just do not know about. 
Which is why I believe that by implementing more connections to more blockchains in one DEX combined with low service charges, improved user UI and UX, and providing stable liquidity within the exchange itself could help to shape the future of what exchanges are used and why.
In terms of a shorter time solution while the more broad fixes are being implemented, it could be of great use to try developing hybrid exchanges that can provide pros from both sides, and possibly be more appealing upfront to the standard user.
## Conclusion

To conclude, the integration, evolution, and representation of DEXs could prove intrumental to improving interoperability in the future, and could be pursued with any of the above solutions and any other possible solutions derived from this paper.
